# Who I am

I was thinking about defining myself in a sentence, but I concluded that's an impossible task. So let me simply describe myself. I am a  lifelong learner passionate about tech, focused on the web with JavaScript as my native programming language and I solve problems with tech based on JavaScript.

I believe that for a healthy industry the professionals must share their experience. Committed to this, I try to give at least one talk/workshop per year in vocational schools, at least before COVID. Moreover, I co-organized and sponsored Global Day of Coderetreat 2019 in Gran Canaria, which is an awesome event for coding students.

I also sponsored other events during the last years as a way to say thanks to the software community. There is no doubt that software communities and open source have been crucial for my professional growth, so I am just paying the favor.
