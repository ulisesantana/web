# Who I am

I bring over eight years of hands-on experience designing, building, and maintaining software systems that scale. My focus is on writing clean, testable code, and I’ve consistently embraced tools and practices that support long-term maintainability such as Clean Architecture, Test-Driven Development, and thorough documentation.

Beyond coding, I’m passionate about growing through community. I actively contribute to open-source projects, deliver internal trainings, and give talks at conferences and vocational schools. I co-organized and sponsored the Global Day of Coderetreat in Gran Canaria, and I’ve supported several community-driven tech events as a way of giving back to the same ecosystem that helped me grow professionally.

After realizing I was suffering a burnout in late 2022, I took a step back to reset. That period helped me reconnect with what matters: people, building sustainable workflows, fostering inclusive team dynamics, and delivering value through simplicity and focus.
