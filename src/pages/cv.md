I’m a Full Stack Developer from the Canary Islands with a strong focus on building maintainable, well-tested software. I’ve been working on digital products since 2013 and professionally developing software since 2016. JavaScript is my native language—both literally and figuratively—and I specialize in Node.js, TypeScript, and frontend technologies like React.

Over the years, I’ve led teams, contributed to large-scale architectures, and implemented practices like Clean Architecture, TDD, and microservices in production environments. I’ve built invoicing engines used by hundreds of thousands of users, deployed microfrontends to millions, and optimized complex Node.js processes from hours to minutes—one of which became the subject of a talk and blog post. I enjoy sharing knowledge, and I’ve trained both teammates and clients in modern JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js asynchronous performance.

Beyond code, I care deeply about how we work as developers. I believe in sustainable practices, continuous learning, and giving back to the community through talks, workshops, and open-source tools. I’m also passionate about creativity—whether it’s designing developer tools, walking in nature with my dog Mocha, or learning to produce music.

In late 2022, I recognized I was experiencing burnout and took a conscious step back to recover. That pause helped me reconnect with what truly matters: people. Since then, I’ve been intentional about creating healthier, more sustainable ways of working—not only through practices like TDD or clean architecture, but also by fostering environments where well-being is part of the process.

As part of mentoring junior developers, I now share not only technical knowledge but also tools for managing stress and recognizing early signs of burnout. Helping others grow without burning out has become one of the most meaningful aspects of my work.
