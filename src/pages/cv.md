# Who am I

I was thinking about defining myself in a sentence, but I concluded that's an impossible task. So let me simply describe myself. I am a  lifelong learner passionate about tech, focused on the web with JavaScript as my native programming language and I solve problems with tech based on JavaScript.

I believe that for a healthy industry the professionals must share their experience. Committed to this, I try to give at least one talk/workshop per year in vocational schools. Moreover, I co-organized and sponsored the last Global Day of Coderetreat in Gran Canaria, which is an awesome environment for coding students.

I also sponsored other events during the last years as part of my giveback plan to the software community. There is no doubt that software communities and open source have been crucial for my professional growth, so I am just returning the favor.
