jobs:
  - employer: Kentech
    location: Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain (Hybrid)
    position: Frontend Developer
    from: 01/2024
    to: Present
    description:
      - At Kentech, I’ve been responsible for leading the technical foundation of several
        frontend initiatives within a high-traffic environment serving millions of users
        worldwide. My day-to-day involves designing maintainable architecture, refactoring
        legacy code to align with Clean Architecture principles, and ensuring that performance
        and clarity remain at the core of every solution. I frequently work on technical spikes
        and maintain internal documentation that helps reduce knowledge silos and improves
        onboarding across the team.
      - I’ve also contributed to fostering a Test-Driven Development (TDD) mindset among developers.
        Through pair programming sessions and offering support when teammates reach out for guidance,
        I’ve helped normalize testing as a natural part of the development workflow. Since adopting
        this approach, the test coverage of our main project has increased by more than 1000%,
        transforming the codebase into a more stable and predictable foundation. This shift has
        not only improved product reliability but also enhanced our ability to refactor with confidence
        and iterate faster.
      - Also, I was involved in the recruitment process, interviewing candidates
        for frontend backend positions. I focused on assessing not just technical skills,
        but also cultural fit and alignment with our values of collaboration, continuous learning,
        and craftsmanship. Furthermore, I proposed a new technical test for candidates, focusing on a
        way to evaluate their problem-solving skills and understanding of software design in an objective way.

    description:
      - At Triditive, I contributed remotely to the development of a platform designed
        to manage additive manufacturing workflows. During my time there, I supported
        various technical tasks and looked for opportunities to add value in a dynamic
        and rapidly evolving environment. Despite the short engagement, I remained
        committed to writing clean code, collaborating asynchronously, and documenting
        my work to support the broader team.

    position: Full Stack Developer
    from: 03/2020

    description:
      - At Lean Mind, I worked remotely as part of multidisciplinary teams for various clients,
        contributing to products ranging from e-learning platforms to billing systems and audience
        intelligence tools. The company operates with a strong commitment to Software Craftsmanship
        and eXtreme Programming, which aligned deeply with my own values as a developer. Our work
        focused not just on delivering features, but on building maintainable, well-tested, and
        meaningful software.
      - I was involved in full-stack development using technologies such as Node.js, TypeScript,
        React, and occasionally PHP when maintaining legacy systems. I regularly practiced pair
        programming and Test-Driven Development (TDD), and helped guide architectural decisions
        with long-term sustainability in mind. In one of the projects, our team was able to deliver
        features to production with zero bug reports thanks to a robust testing strategy and a focus
        on simplicity. We also achieved significant performance improvements by optimizing data-heavy
        processes that previously took weeks to run, reducing them to a single day. Beyond client work,
        I mentored apprentices—one of whom later joined the company—and led internal training sessions
        to foster continuous learning within the team. Lean Mind’s culture of trust, feedback, and
        continuous learning made this one of the most enriching stages of my career.

    description:
      - After being promoted within Kentech, I took on broader responsibilities across both
        backend and frontend development. Depending on the team’s needs, I would alternate
        between building backend services in Node.js or PHP, and implementing frontend
        features with frameworks like AngularJS and React. I often collaborated closely with
        solution architects and team leaders to design scalable, practical solutions aligned
        with project goals.
      - During this time, I played an active role in modernizing our development practices.
        I introduced several tools and methodologies to the team, including TypeScript, NestJS,
        Storybook, Microfrontends, Cypress, Husky, and the creation of internal npm packages.
        These efforts contributed to a more cohesive and maintainable codebase, as well as
        improved testing and documentation standards. Beyond development, I also supported
        production deployments, maintained development environments, and helped interview and
        onboard new developers for both frontend and backend positions.

    position: Backend Developer
    from: 06/2017
    to: 07/2018
    description:
      - I was hired as a Backend Developer due to my interest and performance
        in Node.js tasks during my internship.
        In the first six months, my main tasks were coding new features on Node.js
        microservices, helping the infrastructure area and handling deployments
        on our environments before CI/CD came to our lives. That means handling
        web servers with Nginx and pm2 processes for Node.js, besides handling
        all the files on servers for other services. Thankfully, some really smart
        teammates deployed Rancher with Docker connected with our Gitlab, giving us
        the chance to add CI/CD on our workflow.
      - During the following six months, I gradually stop working on infrastructure
        and started creating new features across all the stack. I also evangelized
        best practices about ES2017 Promises with async / await.

        certification is doing an internship in a company of your choice. I chose
        Kentech because was the only company I found in Gran Canaria who was
        using Node.js at that time. Also, was a really good opportunity to test
        my English skills because the communication on Kentech is full in English.
      - I started as a QA, but after some weeks testing the main web app, they
        gave me some tasks related to UI optimization for Opera Mini and creating
        a Wordpress theme for a corporative site. In the last weeks, my mentor
        explained the microservices architecture and some basics about high
        availability concepts. Also, he challenged me to do a proof of concept
